// "Data folder not found -> continue with an empty folder" prompt). This exists because a bare
// existsSync/statSync-in-try-catch collapses EVERY failure into "false", so a non-ENOENT stat error
// (a transient I/O hiccup, a permission error, or an encoding/`ERROR_NO_UNICODE_TRANSLATION`-class
// failure seen with non-ASCII paths on some Windows setups) was being misread as "the folder was
// deleted" and nagged the user on every launch.
//
// Contract: return true ONLY when stat proves the path is absent (ENOENT/ENOTDIR). Any other error is
// indeterminate — we cannot conclude the data is gone, and wrongly offering to start empty risks
// abandoning the user's real data — so we return false (don't nag) and log only a fixed category.
